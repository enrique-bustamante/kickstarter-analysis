### Recommendation

When looking at the first chart, it is evident that plays have the most Kickstarter campaigns by far. In addition, there are more successful campaigns

The initial goal of $20k is very high, especially when looking at successful versus failed campaigns. Failed campaigns were asking for an average of $10k per failed campaign as opposed to the successful campaigns which averaged $5k. 

Additionally, plays tend to be some of the most successful campaigns. To ensure a more successful campaign, it would be recommended to drop the goal from $20k to $3-5k. This seems to be a range in which more peopled are more willing to contribute to.
